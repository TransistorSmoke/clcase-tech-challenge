      <h5>As part of this exercise can you please create the following:</h5>
      <br>

      <div class="my-2">
         <p><strong>1. A design of what information the new staff member onboarding form should contain. This can be done in: written text, drawn on paper (and scanned) or built in HTML/JavaScript.</strong><p>
        <p class="my-3">
          Please refer to the <a href="./index.html" class="text-decoration-none">EMPLOYEE ONBOARDING form (index.html)</a> for the design.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="my-2">
        <p><strong>2. Regarding the design above, please provide a some written notes on why you made the choices you did.</strong><p>
       <p class="my-3">
         The contents of form, based on experience, is usually the basic information asked during onboarding. I recall also last August, when I joined my current company, this information was also asked. Also, a quick search on Google on oboarding forms in Australia yielded this form. I took this form and rendered it with Bootstrap (the quickest way) and some customisation with SCSS.

     <div class="my-2">
      <p><strong>3. A program to calculate the annual tax and superannuation for a given salary (please see rate table below). This can be done in: Java or JavaScript</strong><p>
      <p class="my-3">
        Please refer to the <a href="./tax-super.html" class="text-decoration-none">TAX/SUPER calculator page</a> (tax-super.html) and custom.js file for my solution.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="my-2">
      <p><strong>4. A few written or programmed tests to prove the tax and superannuation calculations.</strong><p>
      <p class="my-3">
        Please try the tax and superannuation calculator in the said page. Comparing it against the results I tested in paycalculator.com, I have found that the tax calculation results are consistent those in paycalculator.com for a specific tax year of 2019-2020. I hope it is good enough.
